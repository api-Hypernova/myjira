#!/bin/bash

#we create a few basic commands like add <jira>, edit, remove, close, resolve, comment, assign, etc

#the interface should be interactive and not outside the program. You should enter commands at a prompt like gdb or something 

#A Jira should be a export file which contains all the goodies. these commands should append/edit/rewrite information. 

#sync should be done through github itself. Each command should first pull, edit, then push. Random numbers can be generated through unix timestamps etc

#there should be a main while loop blocked by a read command 

#the script should be able to push/pull without password. 

#there should be an installer that drops this in your bin so you can call it anywhere Remember to keep all paths absolute
